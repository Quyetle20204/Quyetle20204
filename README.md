## ðŸ“Š Notable Projects
### Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Analysis

- **Description**: This project focuses on analyzing user behavior and mobile device usage time, with the aim of gaining a deeper understanding of app usage habits, screen-on time, battery consumption, and other factors related to mobile phone usage. The main objective is to provide insights into how factors such as age, gender, and user behavior influence mobile device usage, and from there, offer recommendations for healthier and more efficient technology use.
- **Technologies Used**: Python with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data processing and visualization.

### Predict Conversion in Digital Marketing

- **Description**: This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict customer conversion in digital marketing, by applying the CART algorithm combined with the Gini index for data splitting. The goal of the project is to develop a high-accuracy prediction model that is easy to implement in practice and can help businesses build effective and sustainable marketing strategies. Methods like Pruning and the Balanced Bagging Classifier are used to optimize the model, reduce overfitting, and address class imbalance in the data, thereby enhancing the model's ability to predict customer conversions.
- **Technologies Used**: Python with libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, sklearn.
